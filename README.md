# COVI02-01
Foundation courses Week 2 COVI02-01 Assignment
In this assignment, you will practice creating and manipulating PyTorch tensors, with a focus on broadcasting operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- OpenCV

## Tasks

Complete the functions in `template.py`:

1. Create a tensor `tensorA` of dimension (12,23,3) with positive values
2. Create a tensor `tensorB` of dimension (3,4) with positive values
3. Perform a multiplication broadcast of `tensorA` and `tensorB` to create `tensorC`
4. Determine the shape of the resulting broadcast tensor

## Submission

Your solution will be automatically tested when you push your code. Make sure all tests pass before the deadline.

## Grading

Your assignment will be graded based on passing the automated tests. Each function is worth 25% of the total grade.
